## About

**Joiner – Collage Camera** is a camera app conceived as an artwork: by tracing a finger across the screen, users can "crop" fragments of the landscape and generate collage photographs in real time, with the immediacy of drawing. By shooting with slight shifts in angle and time, or by combining distant places within a single frame, the app lets users create and share collages with endlessly varied results.

The work was made as an homage to David Hockney's **Joiners**, a group of photo-collage works composed of Polaroids and other photographs.

### 日本語

《Joiner – Collage Camera》は、画面を指でなぞるだけで風景を切り取り、絵を描くような感覚でリアルタイムにコラージュ写真を生成できるカメラアプリとして制作された作品である。角度や時間をずらしながら撮影したり、離れた場所を同一画面上に組み合わせたりすることで、工夫次第で多様な表情をもつコラージュ写真を制作・共有することができる。

本作は、デイヴィッド・ホックニーがポラロイド写真などを組み合わせて制作したフォトコラージュ作品群《Joiners》へのオマージュとして制作された。

## History

In 2012, the Tokyo Photographic Art Museum acquired the work together with an iPhone 3GS on which the app was installed; over time, however, battery deterioration made it difficult to power on. 

For this project, as part of the **TOKYO Smart Culture Project***, exonemo re-examined both the program and the original device, successfully carried out the migration, and open-sourced the code.

### 収蔵と復元

2012年に東京都写真美術館へiPhone 3GSの実機とともに収蔵されたが、バッテリーの劣化により起動が困難な状態にあった。今回、「TOKYOスマート・カルチャー・プロジェクト」の一環で、エキソニモがプログラムと実機の再検証を行い、マイグレーションを実現し、ソースコードのオープン化を行った。

## TOKYO Smart Culture Project

The "TOKYO Smart Culture Project" is led by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and the Tokyo Photographic Art Museum, which is operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Foundation for History and Culture. The project digitizes cultural resources held by Tokyo Metropolitan cultural institutions—including collection holdings and records related to exhibitions and performances—so they can be documented, preserved, and experienced in a range of formats.

As part of this project, since FY2023 the Tokyo Photographic Art Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo have been carrying out media migration and format conversion—work essential to long-term preservation—for collection works in time-based media, including film, video, slides, audio, and computer-based works. In recent years, as a growing number of works have come to require maintenance and migration as they age, it has become increasingly important to consider how best to store and exhibit them in the years ahead. By addressing the conservation and restoration challenges posed by time-based media holdings—and by making them widely accessible to the public—the project aims to carry these works forward to the next generation.
